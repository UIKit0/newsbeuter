# Where is the SVN Repository? #

"The newsbeuter SVN repository is empty. Where can I find the source code?" many people ask. Until December 2008, newsbeuter was hosted in a SVN repository. In December 2008, it was transitioned to GitHub: http://github.com/akrennmair/newsbeuter/

There are currently no plans to transition the repository to Google.
