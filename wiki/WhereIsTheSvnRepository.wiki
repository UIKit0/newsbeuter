= Where is the SVN Repository? =

"The newsbeuter SVN repository is empty. Where can I find the source code?" many people ask. The answer is simple: it is hosted externally, namely here: http://bereshit.synflood.at/svn/noos/

This is because of historical reasons. There are currently no plans to transition the repository to Google.
